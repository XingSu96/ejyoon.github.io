I am a PhD student in Department of Psychology at Stanford University. I work with Dr. [Michael C. Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) in [Language and Cognition Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu/). I am primarily interested in how adults and children understand speaker's goals behind utterances, looking at polite language as a case study of speech that reflects various goals such as goals to inform others, to be prosocial and kind, and to present oneself in a good light.
