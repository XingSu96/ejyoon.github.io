I am a Teaching Coordinator for Symbolic Systems Program at Stanford University, where I am primarily responsible for coordinating <a href="https://symsys1.stanford.edu">Symsys 1</a>, the introduction course required of Symsys undergraduate majors. 
<br><br>
Before, I was a PhD student in Department of Psychology at Stanford University, working with [Dr. Michael C. Frank](https://web.stanford.edu/~mcfrank/) in [Language and Cognition Lab](http://langcog.stanford.edu/). My research focuses on how adults and children understand speaker's goals behind utterances, looking at polite language as a case study of speech that reflects various goals such as goals to inform others, to be prosocial and kind, and to present oneself in a good light.
